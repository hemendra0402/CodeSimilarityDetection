The goal of this project idea is to develop and implement an algorithm for assigning similarity
scores between each function in a source code file against each other function in a different
source code file.
1. Given two different source code files.
2. Output a matrix of similarity scores between all pairings of the functions from one of the
files with the functions of the other file’s functions.
● The algorithm can be implemented in C/C++, or Java.
● Develop collections of attributes as a “profile” to base similarity comparisons on (i.e.
function return type, signature parameter count, etc.)
● Justify and compare the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches (i.e. is the
profile reasonable to collect, is it fast to make comparisons between profiles, etc).
● Conduct experimental testing of the implemented solution for correctness.
● Explore the balance between being too abstract and too narrow in comparing two
functions
